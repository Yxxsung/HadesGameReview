                In the videogame Hades, you play as the son of Hades, Zagreus. Zagreus is trying to escape the underworld
                to find his birth mother, having just discovered Nix is not his real mother. <br>While playing as Zagreus, you
                fight your way through the three levels of the underworld; Tartarus, Asphodel, and Eluysium before fighting
                Hades himself on the journey to find his mother, Persephone. <br>
                In each of the three levels you encounter various enemies of different strengths including two bosses per level.
