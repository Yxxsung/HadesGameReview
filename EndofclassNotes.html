                <br><br>Hi Professor Carver!<br><br>

            </h2>

            <p>

                I had no idea what to make the 6th page about, so I decided to write you a little letter about what I
                <br>learned in this class, enjoyed and disliked as well as some reflective notes on my own habits.
                <br>Firstly, I loved your class and I really enjoyed having you as my professor! You are approachable,
                <br>kind, and relatively understanding which I really appriciated during this term! Once I got behind I
                <br>had a really hard time catching up, in fact I never really did, hence the final being turned in two
                <br>days late.
                <br><br>I got to learn a lot in this class that I didn't know before and I'm so much more confident in my
                <br>HTML and CSS skills! (mainly HTML). I'm far from perfect but I feel like I'm really starting to get ahold
                <br>of the basics. W3 schools was such a help and I still use it a lot (I used it for a lot of this Final).
                <br>There is still a lot I could do to improve this website (and I mean A LOT), but I'm really happy with
                <br>what I did get done and the massive amount of code I wrote to get to this point. I will likely continue
                <br>experimenting on this page as I continue learning more about website development.
